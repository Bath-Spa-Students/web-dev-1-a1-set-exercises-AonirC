        <h1>Identity V</h1>
        <p>After being recruited to locate a girl who has vanished, Orpheus the detective discovers the enigmatic Oletus Manor. The story of the game invites players to piece together the truth about Oletus Manor and its troubled past since it is full of mystery and intrigue.</p>
     Identity V is a game of asymmetrical multiplayer in which one player becomes the hunter, and four others go in as survivors. Now, if the title did not give it away already, the job of that hunter is very obvious: to hunt down those survivors and take them out of the game by way of rocket chairs. On the other hand, the survivors have to figure everything out through typewriters. With finally making it out of the dungeon's exit and evading the clutches of the hunter,. It's hence considerably different from an introductory game. Story and dialogue-heavy early scenes give way to a mysterious room in the mansion you find yourself in, ending up being nothing more than an interactive menu where you are walking towards objects to access the store, matchmake, or customize your characters. As survivors, you have to dart from one of the marked typewriters to another to fully decipher, and then the last door will open. Of course, meantime, you have to avoid the hunter, who is a whole lot faster than you are. You can interact with the environment to knock over pallets that block the path of the hunter, and you can jump over ledges that the hunter can't, giving you a chance to get away no matter how fast the hunter is. You can also see items in chests and hide places, but how good this is depends on who plays the hunter. As for the hunter, your business is only with the survivors. Track them, slash them, kick them out of the game. Once you've slapped them around twice they'll fall to the floor, at which you can then pick them up and carry them over to a rocket chair where, after a little loading time, they'll be blasted out of the game. Really fairly family-friendly stuff, actually, considering the horror flavor of the game.</body>
